# Hangman-game
Hangman is a classic word-guessing game where players attempt to deduce a hidden word by suggesting letters within a limited number of incorrect guesses. Each incorrect guess results in a part of a stick figure being drawn; the game ends when the word is guessed correctly or the drawing is completed.&amp;#x20;
